Purpose: This include file configures the tracking subsystem of the Sitecore Experience Database so that it schedules new online visits
for aggregation into the reporting database.

If you want to disable this functionality and prevent new visits from being aggregated into the reporting database, you must rename this 
config file so that it has a ".disabled" extension.
